      <h4 class="center" style="color: #d0ae2b;">About Us (RideOn)</h4>

      <div class="para_area">
        <h5 class="para_heading fontbold" style="color: #1d1919;">THE BEGINNING</h5>
        <hr>
        <p style="color: #f2f2f2;">The Enfield Cycle Company made motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers and stationary engines under the name RideOn out of its works based at Redditch, Worcestershire. The legacy of weapons manufacture is reflected in the logo comprising the cannon, and
          the motto "Made like a gun". Use of the brand name RideOn was licensed by the Crown in 1890.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- /.para_area -->

      <div class="para_area">
        <h5 class="para_heading fontbold" style="color: #1d1919;">THE EARLY YEARS</h5>
        <hr>
        <p style="color: #f2f2f2;">In 1909 RideOn surprised the motorcycling world by introducing a small Motorcycle with a 2 ¼ HP V twin Motosacoche engine of Swiss origin. In 1911 the next model was powered by a 2 ¾ HP engine and boasted of the well known Enfield 2-speed gear.
          In 1912 came the JAP 6 HP 770 CC V twin with a sidecar combination. It was this motorcycle which made Enfield a household name. 1914 saw the 3 HP motorcycles this time with Enfield’s own engine which now had the standardised Enfield paint scheme
          of black enamelled parts and green tank with gold trim.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- /.para_area -->

      <div class="para_area">
        <h5 class="para_heading fontbold" style="color: #1d1919;">BETWEEN THE WARS</h5>
        <hr>
        <p style="color: #f2f2f2;">At the time of the outbreak of WW I RideOn supplied consignments of their 6 HP sidecar Outfit motorcycles with Stretchers to the Crown. This same motorcycle also came with a Vickers machine Gun sidecar attachment which could also be turned skywards
          and used against low flying aircraft. Royal Enfield supplied large numbers of motorcycles to the British War Department and also won a motorcycle contract for the Imperial Russian Government. As the factory developed in the 20’s the range of models
          also increased and in 1924 Royal Enfield was offering four versions of the 2 ¼ HP two-stroke motorcycle, two new JAP engined 350 cc motorcycles and two versions of the 8 HP Vickers engine sidecar combinations. During the great depression of the
          30’s Royal Enfield was also affected and the demand for motorcycles waxed and waned but the bicycle manufacturing continued at the same pace and the company trudged on. The Cycar, a fully enclosed motorcycle model appeared in the early 30’s. During
          World War II, like other manufacturers of that time Royal Enfield was also called upon by the British authorities to develop and manufacture military motorcycles. The models produced for the military were the WD/C 350 cc SV, WD/CO 350 cc OHV,
          WD/D 250 cc SV, WD/G 350 cc OHV and WD/L 570 cc SV. One of the most well-known Enfields was the Royal Enfield WD/RE, known as the Flying Flea, a lightweight 125 cc motorcycle designed to be dropped by parachute with airborne troops. After the
          war the factory continued manufacturing the models developed during the war and the legendary J 2 model appeared which went on to be the ancestor of the legendary Bullet. The same motorcycle which perhaps had the honour of the being the one with
          the longest production run in the world.</p>

      <div class="para_area">
        <h5 class="para_heading fontbold" style="color: #1d1919;">THE INDIA CONNECTION</h5>
        <hr>
        <p style="color: #f2f2f2;">Royal Enfield motorcycles were being sold in India ever since 1949. In 1955, the Indian government started looking for a suitable motorcycle for its police forces and the army for patrolling duties on the country's border. The Bullet 350 was chosen
          as the most suitable bike for the job. The Indian government ordered 800 of these 350 cc motorcycles, an enormous order for that time. Thus In 1955, the Redditch Company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form what was called 'Enfield India'
          to assemble these 350 cc Bullet motorcycle under licence in erstwhile madras (Now called Chennai). As per their agreement Madras Motors owned the majority (over 50%) of shares in the company. In 1957 tooling equipment was also sold to Enfield
          India so that they could manufacture components and start full-fledged production. The Enfield Bullet dominated the Indian highways and with each passing year its popularity kept rising.</p>

      <div class="para_area">
        <h5 class="para_heading fontbold" style="color: #1d1919;">CLOSEOUT IN THE UK</h5>
        <hr>
        <p style="color: #f2f2f2;">Royal Enfield UK continued manufacturing motorcycles and came out with some more innovative and powerful machines notably the Royal Enfield Meteor, Constellation and finally the Interceptor 700, before being sold to Norton-Triumph-Villiers (NVT)
          in 1968. Production ceased in 1970 and the company was dissolved in 1971. Remaining tooling and equipment of the Redditch works were auctioned off. Meanwhile the Bullet 350 continued to be manufactured in India and by the 1980’s the motorcycles
          were even exported to Europe out of India. Even after the motorcycle manufacturing closed down the precision engineering division ran for some more time and even bicycles were produced until quite late.</p>
